# Face-recognition-pca-technique
I am Sanskar Jaiswal, a 1st year student in IIT Bombay.My "Summer of code" project is Face recognistion by using PCA and involves statistics.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of training set of face images than compare it with the test images in every category.

Assignments:-

1.In my codes for the iris data set which was to get familiar with the concept of pca, I calculated the mean squared distance and assigned it to the category with minimum mean sqaured distance.
I got a accuracy of around 68%.

2.In the advanced data set(i.e yale extended data set) i initially reduced the dimension and proceeded without neural net method which gave an accuracy of 71% but later i realised how the accuracy would be affected
by using neural networks so i looked for some reference  and found it on github. the link is-https://github.com/vtshitoyan/simpleNN. I trained the reduced images in NN and then passed the test images through my trained neural net for classification.
THen, i got a accuracy upto 97%.
