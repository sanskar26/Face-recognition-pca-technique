# Face-recognition-pca-technique
This was my "Summer of code" project on Face recognistion using optmised statistical technique PCA.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of face images in the training set.

Milestones:-
  * In my codes for the iris data set which was to get familiar with the concept of pca, I calculated the mean squared distance and assigned it to the category with minimum mean sqaured distance. Got a accuracy of around 68%.

  * In the advanced data set(i.e yale extended data set) i initially reduced the dimension and proceeded without neural net method which gave an accuracy of 71% but later i realised how the accuracy would be affected by using neural networks so i looked for some reference  and found it on github. the link is-https://github.com/vtshitoyan/simpleNN. I trained the reduced images in NN and then passed the test images through my trained neural net for classification. This time, i got a accuracy about 97%.
